I'm a huge fan of [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/)'s [Tensor Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles/tree/main) for training your tensor programming muscle. LLM's are pretty good at writing pytorch or numpy code, but you still need a solid grasp of tensor operations to verify the code, and the code they write isn't expert quality (yet).

This notebook is a sequel to Tensor Puzzles, for those looking for additional practice, with a whole different collection of problems.

I highly recommend running the notebook in Colab. Click here and copy the notebook to start.

### diagrams

All diagrams were generated with the help of [tensordiagram](https://github.com/hardik-vala/tensordiagram)—a special-purpose python library for visualizing tensors—and [chalk](https://chalk-diagrams.github.io/)—a general-purpose python graphics library.
